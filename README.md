CleverStyle is beautiful dark theme for PhpStorm/WebStorm/etc.

It was configured for ALL languages, supported by PhpStorm (PHP/CSS/JS/LESS/SASS/CoffeeScript/YAML/JSON/HAML/XML).

I'm using this theme with font "DejaVu Sans Mono" and size 11, so you can try that too to get native experience.

This theme looks the best with Dracula UI.

Screenshot is not up to date, just try it live, because it is awesome!
